# FC Goals

FC Goals is a fictional football (soccer) team with its results stored in a Google Sheets worksheet. This is a Python terminal app to analyse the results and add new match results also.


## How to Use

Users are presented with various filters through the app to guide them to the option they would like to use.

The primary filter allows the user to either enter new match data or check past match data.

Depending on their selection they will be taken to the next relevant option with further sub-filters available on the 'past match data' filter.

## Features

- Enter new details for FC Goals which are updated in real time on the Google Sheets linked.

- Validates new data entered is of sufficient length.

- Offers various filters to check past match results.

- Set up to work if further seasons are added later and if further results are added to the sheet.

- Prints results of past match data to the user depending on their input.

## Future Features

The app could be further enhanced in the future by implementing:

- Score predictor 

    - Analyse past results against an opposition and get average goals scored/conceded.
    - Analyse recent form and average goals scored/conceded again.
    - Combine a mean of these averages and round suitably to create a score prediction. 

- Top Scorer 

    - Add 'Goalscorer(s)' column to the sheet and use this data to analyse the top scorer for a particular season.
